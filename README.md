# End-to-End Smart City Data Engineering Project 🌆

## Overview 🌍

In an era of rapid urban expansion and technological evolution, smart cities have emerged as essential for enhancing sustainability and efficiency in urban living. This project leads the way in leveraging Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing to revolutionize urban operations, making cities more livable and smarter.

### Introduction 📖

Smart cities use advanced data and technology to significantly improve urban infrastructure, public services, and more. Our project aims to harness the vast potential of Big Data, collecting, processing, and analyzing data across the city—traffic patterns, weather conditions, emergency incidents—to bring transformative improvements to urban living.

### Project Goals 🎯

- Optimize urban mobility by integrating Big Data, IoT, and cloud computing.
- Enhance the driving experience from Central London to Birmingham, reducing travel times and improving safety.
- Demonstrate the significant impact of real-time data collection and analysis on urban planning and emergency responses.

## System Architecture 🏗️

Designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and capable of real-time data processing, our project incorporates:

- Docker containers for deploying services in a master-worker architecture.
- AWS Cloud services for data storage, warehousing, and analytics.
- IoT services for data collection from diverse sources across the city.

### Key Technologies 🔑

- **Docker:** Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **AWS Cloud:** Provides robust data storage and processing capabilities.
- **Apache Spark:** Manages large-scale data processing in a distributed environment.
- **IoT Services:** Collects essential data on traffic, weather, and more.

## Implementation 💻

### Data Collection 📡

We utilize IoT devices across the city to collect data on traffic, weather, vehicle movements, and more, enabling real-time analytics and informed decision-making.

### Data Processing ⚙️

Data is ingested through Kafka, serving as the central hub for real-time data streams. Apache Spark processes these streams, delivering insights and analytics that drive decision-making and operational efficiencies.

### Data Analysis 📊

We leverage AWS Glue for data cataloging and Amazon Redshift for data warehousing, enabling sophisticated analysis and insights.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋
